Model Performance Summary
The Random Forest Regressor achieved strong predictive performance with an RÂ² score of 0.87, indicating that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the target variable. The RMSE of 0.98 and MAE of 0.75 suggest that while the model performs well, some prediction errors persist.

Limitations
a)Feature Redundancy: The high-dimensional hyperspectral data may contain correlated features, which could introduce noise.
b)Overfitting Risk: Random forest can overfit, especially with complex datasets. Further regularization and tuning could improve generalization.
c)Non-Linear Relationships: Random Forest might not fully capture some relationships in the data, suggesting potential improvements using neural networks or boosting methods.
d)Curse of Dimensionality: Despite using PCA, the high-dimensional nature of hyperspectral data can still introduce redundancy and computational inefficiency.
e)Lack of Temporal Data: The dataset does not account for temporal variations, which could affect vomitoxin levels.
f)Model Interpretability: Random Forest provides feature importance but lacks transparency in decision-making compared to linear models.
g)Class Imbalance: The model might struggle with generalisation if specific ranges of vomitoxin levels are underrepresented.
h)Environmental Variability: External factors like humidity, temperature, and storage conditions, which impact mycotoxin formation, are not included in the dataset.

## Conclusion
Using hyperspectral data through PCA and Random Forest regression, the model effectively predicts vomitoxin levels.
