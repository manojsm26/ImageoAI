# ImagoAI Corn Vomitoxin Detection Project

This project analyses hyperspectral imaging data of corn samples to detect and predict vomitoxin (DON) contamination levels. The project uses machine learning techniques to process and analyze the spectral data to predict the concentration of vomitoxin in parts per billion (ppb).

## Project Overview

The project involves processing hyperspectral imaging data from corn samples, where each sample contains 448 spectral bands and a corresponding vomitoxin concentration measurement. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the vomitoxin levels in corn samples based on their spectral signatures.

## Data Structure

The dataset contains:
- 448 spectral bands (columns 0-447)
- Sample IDs (hsi_id)
- Vomitoxin concentration in ppb (vomitoxin_ppb)

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure

- `Imageoai_ML_Intern.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- `TASK-ML-INTERN (1).csv`: Dataset containing the hyperspectral imaging data

## Usage

1. Place the dataset file (`TASK-ML-INTERN (1).csv`) in the project directory
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Imageoai_ML_Intern.ipynb`
3. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train and evaluate the machine learning model
   - Generate predictions and visualizations

## Data Processing Flow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Load the CSV file containing hyperspectral data
   - Separate features (spectral bands) and target (vomitoxin levels)
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning and normalization

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Analyze the distribution of vomitoxin levels
   - Visualize spectral patterns
   - Identify potential correlations between spectral bands and vomitoxin levels

3. Model Development
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train machine learning models
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
   - Fine-tune model parameters for optimal results

4. Results and Visualization
   - Generate predictions on test data
   - Create visualizations of results
   - Analyze model performance and accuracy
